# TerraWeek Day 6: Terraform Providers

## Learn about Terraform providers and compare their features across different cloud platforms.

- Terraform providers and their significance in managing resources across various cloud platforms or infrastructure services.


- Compare the features and supported resources for each cloud platform's Terraform provider to gain a better understanding of their capabilities.


## Explore provider configuration and set up authentication for each provider.

- Explore provider configuration and authentication mechanisms in Terraform.


- Set up authentication for each provider on your local machine to establish the necessary credentials for interaction with the respective cloud platforms.


## Gain hands-on experience using Terraform providers for your chosen cloud platform.

- Choose a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or others) as your target provider for this task.

  
- Create a Terraform configuration file named `main.tf` and configure the chosen provider within it.

  
- Authenticate with the chosen cloud platform using the appropriate authentication method (e.g., access keys, service principals, or application default credentials).


- Deploy a simple resource using the chosen provider. For example, if using AWS, you could provision a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Subnet Group, Route Table, Internet Gateway, or a virtual machine.


- Experiment with updating the resource configuration in your `main.tf` file and apply the changes using Terraform. Observe how Terraform intelligently manages the resource changes.


- Once you are done experimenting, use the `terraform destroy` command to clean up and remove the created resources.
