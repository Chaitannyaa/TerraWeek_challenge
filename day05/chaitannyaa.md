# TerraWeek Day 5

## Task 1: 
- What are **modules** in Terraform and why do we need modules in Terraform?

Modules in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configuration that are used to organize and reuse infrastructure code. At its simplest, a module can be a collection of resources that are used together to create a particular piece of infrastructure, such as an EC2 instance in AWS, a Resource Group in Azure, or a Cloud Storage bucket in GCP.

Here's an example of how you might use a simple module to create an EC2 instance on AWS:

1. First, you would create a directory to hold your module. In this example, I'll call it ec2-instance:

```sh
./modules/ec2-instance/
```

2. Inside this directory, you would create xyz.tf file to hold your Terraform code. Let's call it main.tf. Here's some sample code that defines an EC2 instance:

```sh
# ./modules/ec2-instance/main.tf

resource "aws_instance" "ec2-instance" {
  ami           = var.ami
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name      = var.key_name

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

This code defines an EC2 instance resource in AWS using AWS provider. The ami, instance_type, and key_name are variables that can be passed into the module when it is used.

3. Next, you would create a file to hold input variables for your module. Let's call it variables.tf:

```sh
# ./modules/ec2-instance/variables.tf

variable "ami" {
  default = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}

variable "key_name" {
  default = ""
}
```

This file defines the variables that can be passed into our ec2-instance module.

4. Finally, you would create a file to hold output variables for your module. Let's call it outputs.tf:

```sh
# ./modules/ec2-instance/outputs.tf

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.ec2-instance.public_ip
}

output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.ec2-instance.id
}
```

This file defines the output values that our ec2-instance module will return when it is used.

5. Once you've created your module, you can use it in your Terraform code by calling module.<name> and passing in any necessary inputs.

```sh
# main.tf

module "my_instance" {
  source = "./modules/ec2-instance"

  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = module.my_instance.public_ip
}

output "instance_id" {
  value = module.my_instance.instance_id
}
```
  
In this example, we're using the ec2-instance module we defined earlier and passing in the necessary inputs (ami, instance_type, and key_name). The public_ip and instance_id outputs from the ec2-instance module are returned through the module.my_instance. syntax.

- What are the benefits of using modules in Terraform?

There are several benefits to using modules in Terraform:

**Reusability**: Modules make it easy to reuse infrastructure code across multiple projects or environments. This saves time and reduces errors.
**Simplicity**: Modules provide a simple, standardized way to organize infrastructure code, which makes it easier to read, write, and maintain.
**Scalability**: With modules, you can scale your infrastructure code to handle complex deployments and large teams.
**Abstraction**: Modules abstract away complex infrastructure details, allowing you to focus on the higher-level functionality of your application.
  
## Task 2: 
  
- Create/Define a module in Terraform to encapsulate reusable infrastructure configuration in a modular and scalable manner. For e.g. $\textcolor{yellow}{\textsf{EC2 instance in AWS}}$, $\textcolor{lightblue}{\textsf{Resource Group in Azure}}$, $\textcolor{red}{\textsf{Cloud Storage bucket in GCP}}$.
  
Let's create a module in Terraform to encapsulate the reusable infrastructure configuration for an EC2 instance in AWS, a Resource Group in Azure, and a Cloud Storage bucket in GCP.

Here's an example of how you can define the module:

```hcl
# /modules/infra/main.tf

variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Name for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}

variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}

variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "Name for the Azure Resource Group"
  type        = string
}

variable "storage_bucket_name" {
  description = "Name for the GCP Cloud Storage bucket"
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "Location for the Azure Resource Group and GCP Cloud Storage bucket"
  type        = string
}

# AWS EC2 instance resource
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  subnet_id     = var.subnet_id
  tags = {
    Name = var.instance_name
  }
}

# Azure Resource Group resource
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}

# GCP Cloud Storage bucket resource
resource "google_storage_bucket" "example" {
  name     = var.storage_bucket_name
  location = var.location
}
```
  
In this example, we have defined a module that consists of an EC2 instance in AWS, a Resource Group in Azure, and a Cloud Storage bucket in GCP. The module accepts input variables for customizing the configuration of each resource.

To use this module, create a separate directory for the module and place the above main.tf file inside it. Then, reference the module in your main Terraform configuration:

```hcl
# main.tf

module "infra_module" {
  source                  = "./modules/infra"
  instance_name           = "my-ec2-instance"
  region                  = "us-west-2"
  resource_group_name     = "my-resource-group"
  storage_bucket_name     = "my-storage-bucket"
}
```
  
In this example, we invoke the infra_module module and provide values for the input variables specific to each resource. Adjust the values as per your requirements.

By using this module, you can easily create an EC2 instance in AWS, a Resource Group in Azure, and a Cloud Storage bucket in GCP with consistent and reusable configurations. This approach promotes code organization and scalability in managing infrastructure resources across different cloud providers.

## Task 3: 
- Dig into **modular composition** and **module versioning**.
  
Modular composition refers to the ability to combine multiple modules together to create more complex infrastructure configurations. It allows you to build upon existing modules and compose them in a way that suits your specific requirements. With modular composition, you can create higher-level abstractions and assemble infrastructure components like building blocks.

Modular composition is achieved by leveraging the module block in Terraform. Here's an example of how you might combine two modules to create more complex infrastructure configurations:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

module "web" {
  source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-web-server-cluster"

  name               = "web"
  security_group_ids = [module.vpc.security_group_id]
  subnet_ids         = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}
```

In this example, we're using the terraform-aws-vpc and terraform-aws-web-server-cluster modules to create a VPC and a web server cluster. The web module depends on the vpc module as it requires the VPC security group ID as well as the private subnet IDs.

Module versioning is an essential aspect of managing modules in Terraform. It allows you to track and control the versions of modules used in your infrastructure deployments. By specifying module versions, you ensure that deployments are predictable, reproducible, and resistant to breaking changes. Module versions also provide the ability to introduce new features or improvements without affecting existing deployments.

Terraform provides several approaches for versioning modules. Here are some examples:

### Unconstrained Versions
  
By default, Terraform uses unconstrained versioning, which means it will always fetch the latest version of a module when it is referenced. Here's an example of a module source configuration referencing a module using unconstrained versioning:

```sh
module "example" {
  source = "github.com/organization/module"
}
```

In this example, Terraform will always download the latest version of the module from the github.com/organization/module repository.

### Pinned Versions
You can also specify a specific version of a module to use by pinning it in the module source configuration. Here's an example of how to pin a module to version 1.2.3:

```sh
module "example" {
  source  = "github.com/organization/module"
  version = "1.2.3"
}
```
  
In this example, Terraform will always use version 1.2.3 of the module from the github.com/organization/module repository.

### Module Registry
If you publish your modules to a module registry, such as the Terraform Registry, you can reference them using the registry and version constraints. Here's an example of how to reference a module from the Terraform Registry:

```sh
module "example" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "2.0.0"
}
```

In this example, Terraform is referencing the aws module for creating EC2 instances from the terraform-aws-modules organization in the Terraform Registry. The module is constrained to version 2.0.0.

## Task 4: 
  
- What are the ways to **lock Terraform module versions**? Explain with code snippets.
