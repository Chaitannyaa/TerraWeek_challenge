# TerraWeek Day 7 - Advanced Terraform Topics

## Gain proficiency in using workspaces, remote execution, and collaboration features in Terraform.

- Dive into the concepts of Terraform workspaces and understand how they can be utilized to manage multiple environments.

Terraform Workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments independently within a single Terraform configuration. A workspace is a unique state environment that represents a particular environment or configuration. For example, you may have different workspaces for development, staging, and production environments.

Each workspace can contain different settings or variables, such as different credentials, network configurations, or instance types. However, you will typically use the same Terraform configuration code across all workspaces.

Here are some of the key benefits of using Terraform Workspaces:

- Organize infrastructure as code for different environments in a single codebase.

- Separate state files for each environment, reducing the risk of misconfiguration or conflicts between environments.

- Reduce the duplication of code across multiple configurations.

**here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Terraform workspaces:**

1. Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration and initialize it with the terraform init command.

```sh
$ mkdir my-infra
$ cd my-infra
$ terraform init
```

2. Create a new Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) and define the resources for your infrastructure.

```sh
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

3. Create a new workspace for the dev environment:

```sh
$ terraform workspace new dev
```

4. Switch to the new dev workspace:

```sh
$ terraform workspace select dev
``` 

5. Create a new variable file for the dev environment (e.g., dev.tfvars) and set the variable values specific to this environment.

```sh
# dev.tfvars
access_key = "your_access_key_here"
secret_key = "your_secret_key_here"
```

6. Validate that the configuration syntax for the dev workspace is correct:

```sh
$ terraform validate -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

7. Apply the Terraform configuration to create resources in the dev environment:

```sh
$ terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

8. Create a new workspace for the prod environment:

```sh
$ terraform workspace new prod
```

9. Switch to the new prod workspace:

```sh
$ terraform workspace select prod
```

10. Create a new variable file for the prod environment (e.g., prod.tfvars) and set the variable values specific to this environment.

```sh
# prod.tfvars
access_key = "your_access_key_here"
secret_key = "your_secret_key_here"
```

11. Validate that the configuration syntax for the prod workspace is correct:

```sh
$ terraform validate -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

12. Apply the Terraform configuration to create resources in the prod environment:

```sh
$ terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

You can create more variable files for different environments and apply them to their respective workspaces.

Note that each workspace will have its own state file, so you can switch between them without affecting the resources in other workspaces. Make sure to switch to the correct workspace before running any Terraform commands to avoid making changes to the wrong environment.

- Explore remote execution options such as using remote backends (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Storage Account, or HashiCorp Consul) and understand the benefits they offer.


- Learn about collaboration tools like HashiCorp Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise and how they facilitate team collaboration and version control.

## Learn and implement best practices for organizing your Terraform code, version control, and CI/CD integration.

- Familiarize yourself with Terraform best practices, including code organization, module usage, and naming conventions.


- Explore version control systems (e.g., Git) and learn how to effectively manage your Terraform codebase.


- Understand how to integrate Terraform with CI/CD pipelines and implement automated testing, validation, and deployment strategies.

## Explore additional features available in the Terraform ecosystem, such as Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise, or the Terraform Registry.

- Dive deeper into Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise and understand how they provide enhanced collaboration, infrastructure management, and workflow automation capabilities.

- Discover the Terraform Registry and explore its vast collection of modules and providers to extend the functionality of your infrastructure code.
